#Morse Game

This is a simple game to teach Morse Code.  It just sends one letter at a time, get it right and that bar goes down, get it wrong and it goes back up.  Your goal is to drain all of the bars.

Loosely based on [morse.exe](http://c2.com/~ward/morse/morse.html), a DOS-based game that helped me pass my Tech Plus ham radio license exam back when morse code was required.
